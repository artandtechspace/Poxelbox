Longterm Todos:
- [ ] add blend mode to rendering
- [ ] refactor code to use color class
- [ ] define chached_set_led_call (Name not final), basically a tuple of led
      position + color; for saving calls to set_led_call / saving all data for 
      set_led. (useful in NumberRenderer, BaseRenderer)
- [ ] add highscore *(which is iirc not used anywhere)* to win screen
- [ ] change scene controller to allow more framerates currently it is 
      limiting framerates to increments of 50ms ~ 20 FPS (with everything having >= 50ms ~ <= 20 FPS )

Ideas for future games:
- [ ] Meta Tic-Tac-Toe + Tic-Tac-Toe 
- [ ] Draughts / Checkers / Dame ? 
- [ ] something similar to [Space Travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Travel_(video_game)) ?
